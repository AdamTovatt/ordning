description: Create or update a git worktree for a branch
disable-model-invocation: true

The user wants to work on a branch in a separate worktree. The argument is provided as: `$ARGUMENTS`.

If no argument was provided, ask the user which branch or issue they want.

Follow these steps:

1. **Fetch latest from remote** by running `git fetch origin`.

2. **Determine the branch name:**
   - If the argument is an existing branch name (check with `git branch -a`), use it as-is.
   - If the argument is an issue number (e.g. `#82` or `82`), generate a descriptive branch name in the format `<number>-short-descriptive-kebab-case-name`. Use context from the issue (fetch it with `gh issue view <number>`) to pick a short but descriptive name. For example, issue #82 titled "Unify not-found and unauthorized responses" could become `82-unify-not-found-responses`.

3. **Determine the worktree path**: `../ordning-<branch-name>` (relative to the repo root). For example, branch `azure-session-lifetime-management` becomes `../ordning-azure-session-lifetime-management`.

4. **Check if the worktree already exists** by running `git worktree list` and checking if the path is already listed.

5. **Ask the user for confirmation** before creating or updating the worktree. Show the branch name and worktree path and ask if they want to proceed.

6. **If the worktree does NOT exist:**
   - Run `git worktree add ../ordning-<branch-name> <branch-name>` to create it.
   - If that fails because the branch doesn't exist locally, try `git worktree add -b <branch-name> ../ordning-<branch-name> origin/<branch-name>` to create a local branch tracking the remote.
   - If that also fails (branch doesn't exist on remote either), create a new branch from master: `git worktree add -b <branch-name> ../ordning-<branch-name> origin/master`.
   - Tell the user what happened (checked out existing branch, or created new branch from master).

7. **If the worktree ALREADY exists:**
   - Run `git -C ../ordning-<branch-name> pull` to get the latest changes.
   - Tell the user the worktree was already set up and latest changes have been pulled.

8. **Copy gitignored files to the new worktree** (only when a new worktree was created, not when updating an existing one) by running the `wi` CLI tool:
   ```
   wi init <absolute-path-to-this-repo> <absolute-path-to-new-worktree>
   ```
   This copies build outputs, `.env` files, and other gitignored files from the current repo to the new worktree so it's ready to build and run. Use absolute paths for both arguments. Run `wi help` for more details on usage.

9. **Tell the user how to start working there.** Print a message like:

   ```
   Worktree ready! To start Claude in the worktree, run:
   cd ../ordning-<branch-name> && claude
   ```
