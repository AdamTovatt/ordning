description: Clean up worktrees for branches that have been merged and deleted

The user wants to clean up worktrees that are no longer needed because their branches have been merged and deleted on GitHub.

Follow these steps:

1. **Fetch latest from remote** by running `git fetch origin --prune` to update remote tracking refs and prune deleted branches.

2. **List all worktrees** by running `git worktree list` to get all current worktrees and their branches.

3. **Identify candidates for cleanup.** For each worktree (excluding the main worktree at the repo root):
   - Get the branch name from the worktree list output.
   - Check if the branch still exists on the remote by running `git branch -r --list "origin/<branch-name>"`.
   - If the remote branch is gone, it's a cleanup candidate.

4. **If no candidates are found**, tell the user all worktrees are still active and there's nothing to clean up.

5. **Present the candidates to the user.** Show a summary like:
   ```
   Found worktrees for branches that no longer exist on remote:

   - ../ordning-72-dataset-export (branch: 72-dataset-export)
   - ../ordning-85-fix-login-bug (branch: 85-fix-login-bug)
   ```

   Ask the user which ones they want to remove, or if they want to remove all of them.

6. **For each worktree the user confirms for removal:**
   - Run `git worktree remove <worktree-path>` to remove the worktree.
   - If that fails because of uncommitted changes, inform the user and ask if they want to force it with `git worktree remove --force <worktree-path>`.
   - Delete the local branch with `git branch -d <branch-name>`. If it fails (not fully merged), inform the user and ask if they want to force it with `git branch -D <branch-name>`.

7. **Run `git worktree prune`** to clean up any stale worktree references.

8. **Show a summary** of what was cleaned up:
   ```
   Cleaned up 2 worktree(s):
   - ../ordning-72-dataset-export
   - ../ordning-85-fix-login-bug
   ```
